# TinyUrl Project

Welcome to my url shortening App!

### Installation
Setup is as you are expecting:

```
git clone https://github.com/grey275/TinyApp
cd TinyApp/
npm install
```

To run:
```
node express_server.js
```
The server will listen on 8080 by default, but you can specify it with a command line argument:
```
node express_server.js 8000
```

Enjoy!
